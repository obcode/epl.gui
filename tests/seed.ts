 * The cast as SQL, for the start of an end-to-end run.
 *
 * Since the backend enforces identity, a person with no row in `person` is nobody: the proxy
 * header is resolved against the table, and without a match every request answers 401. That
 * used to be irrelevant because no page needed an identity — which is why this step did not
 * exist before.
 *
 * Generated from `PERSONAS` rather than kept as a file beside it: a second list with the same
 * addresses would be exactly the kind of duplicate that drifts apart when somebody adds a
 * person — and the failure would show up as a 401 in a test that is not about people at all.
