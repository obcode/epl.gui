/**
 * Accessibility, checked automatically.
 *
 * The university is a public body — BayEGovG and BITV 2.0 apply, this is not optional. And the
 * check belongs at the start: axe finds contrast and role defects that cost two minutes each
 * individually and become a project of their own in a finished interface with seven areas.
 *
 * Automated checking catches roughly a third of the real problems. It does not replace a
 * keyboard pass — which is why one stands next to it here rather than instead of it.
