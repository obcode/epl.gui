 * it; without this page there would be no way to use it in production at all. That was exactly
 * the situation on the first attempt.
 *
 * The address is in the URL rather than in a POST: this is a query, not an operation, and a
 * link to a specific diagnosis is precisely what one pastes into a support reply.
