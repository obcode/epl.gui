/**
 * The API reference built from the schema rather than from prose.
 *
 * A hand-maintained field list is wrong from the day it is written — and nobody notices,
 * because documentation does not go red. `schema.graphql` is the committed copy of the backend
 * schema (`pnpm run update-schema`), exactly what `pnpm codegen` reads too: the reference
 * cannot diverge from the typed documents.
 *
 * **What the reference cannot show:** where a directive was applied. GraphQL introspection
 * reports the *definition* of a directive but never its usages — `schema.graphql` comes out of
 * introspection and therefore does not know either. That affects both of the backend's
 * directives, and both work around it with prose, because descriptions do travel:
 *
 * - `@interactiveOnly` is spelled out in the description of each affected field.
 * - `@scope` does it from the other end, at the area: every `ScopeArea` value lists its
 *   fields. In the backend `TestScopeAreasListTheirFields` keeps those lists current.
 *
 * The console on the documentation page is the second answer: anybody who wants to be sure
 * queries the field with a token and sees `null` or `INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`.
